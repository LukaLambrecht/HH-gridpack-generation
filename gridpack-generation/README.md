# Tools for gridpack generation

Note: not standalone, needs a Powheg installation in CMSSW, e.g. following the instructions here: https://gitlab.cern.ch/hh/hhgridpacks.
This folder just contains some tools to run the `python ./run_pwg_condor.py` commands in job submission and redirecting the output.
