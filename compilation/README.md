# Tools for input file compilation

Note: not standalone, needs a Powheg installation in CMSSW.
See the main README for instructions and references.
This folder just contains some tools to prepare an input file specifically for the `ggHH` process with tunable H mass, and to run the compilation in an HTCondor job.

The baseline input file `powheg_ggHH_SM.input` is copied from [here](https://github.com/fabio-mon/genproductions/blob/POWHEGggHH_cmssw106x/bin/Powheg/production/Run3/13p6TeV/Higgs/gg_HH_HEFT/powheg_ggHH_kl_1p00_kt_1p00_c2_0p00.input).
